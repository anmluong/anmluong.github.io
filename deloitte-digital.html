				<p>The client's 30-year-old legacy system is <span id="bold">used to register and certify applicants</span> into federal aid program serving 90,000+ monthly participants from 270+ organizations. How might we <span id="bold">ease the transition</span> from the legacy system to its Salesforce replacement for this flow?</p>

				<h3>Explaining the Household</h3>
				<p>To participate in the federal aid program, applicants must have their information entered into the system's digital form under a Household account. Each Household is made up of one Head of Household and optional Household Members.</p>
				<figure class="doodle">
					<img src="images/deloitte/household-concept.png" class="border-0 mb-4" alt="Household = Head of Household + (Household Members)*">
					<figcaption>A little bit of math and regex (asterisks mean zero or more!)</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<h3>Distinguishing information entry</h3>
				<p>In the legacy system, general Household details like address, phone number, etc., were stored under the Head of Household rather than the overall Household. <span id="bold">Because of how data is stored in Salesforce</span>, Household details had to be under an account rather than an individual contact, which meant <span id="bold">creating an explicit section for Household information entry</span>.</p>

				<h3>Working around lack of user research</h3>
				<p>User observations of the legacy system had not yet been scheduled, so we had to <span id="bold">make assumptions of legacy system operation</span>. To try to supplement the lack of user research, we used the following to navigate our design:</p>

				<h3>Constructing an IA for the legacy system</h3>
				<p>In order for the team to understand all of the functionalities from the legacy system that had to be replaced (beyond the registration/certification flow), I created the information architecture with some help from our lead designer. I can't share it here, but <a target="_top" href="mailto:anmluong@gmail.com">please reach out if you would like to talk more about the IA.</a></p>

				<h2><i class="fas fa-sort" aria-hidden="true"></i> Figuring out the flow steps</h2>
				<h3>Round 1: Building off of our previous OOTB flow</h3>
				<p>Originally, we were going to use the Salesforce Out-of-the-Box (OOTB) Flow Builder, but the limited screen components compromised the user experience. After demoing the OOTB flow, the team got approval to <span id="bold">build a custom flow</span> using the wider range of components offered by the <span id="bold">Salesforce Lightning Design System</span>.</p>
				<figure class="doodle">
					<img src="images/deloitte/OOTB.png" class="border-0 mb-4" alt="Plain cardboard box -> gift box wrapped in a big bow">
					<figcaption>Another major upgrade</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>The OOTB flow had four steps. Household and Head of Household details were inputted in the same step to maintain their original association, but within that step, they were separated into different sections to reinforce the distinction.</p>
				<figure class="doodle">
					<img src="images/deloitte/round1.png" class="border-0 mb-4" alt="Four pieces of paper representing forms: the first with the Household and Head of Household icons, the second with the Household Member icon, the third with a checked circle, and the fourth with a Submit button">
					<figcaption>Household > Member > Certification > Submit</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<h3>Creating our first mockups with the design system</h3>
				<p>I identified components from the Salesforce Lightning Design System that could be used for our flow and took a first pass at creating our Sketch mockups.</p>
				<p><span id="bold">I unfortunately don't have images of our screen iterations, but you can follow our thought process with my doodles!</span> Since we used a design system, the main visual changes were seen in the layout of the form components.</p>
				<h3>Round 2: Streamlining the process</h3>
				<p>From our documentation, we knew that the typical Household size was 1-2 people, meaning we could streamline the flow by <span id="bold">combining the Household and Certification steps</span> (i.e. the minimum amount of information required to complete the flow). This would allow users to skip the second step in a typical Household creation.</p>
				<figure class="doodle">
					<img src="images/deloitte/round2.png" class="border-0 mb-4" alt="">
					<figcaption>Household + Certification > Member > Submit</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<h3>Round 3: Finding informational dependencies</h3>
				<p>Reviewing our designs with the product manager revealed an important information dependency that wasn't documented from the OOTB flow. <span id="bold">Certification details</span> (e.g. length of certification) <span id="bold">depend on Household members' inputted details</span>, but we had revised the OOTB flow to have Certification grouped into our very first step. This meant we couldn't consider additional Household Members into certification. I then revised the flow to <span id="bold">separate Certification as its own step again</span> and included relevant read-only Household information to inform these inputs.</p>
				<figure class="doodle">
					<img src="images/deloitte/round3.png" class="border-0 mb-4" alt="">
					<figcaption>A little d&eacute;j&agrave; vu... Household > Member > Certification > Submit</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<h3>Round 4: Submitting vs. saving along the way</h3>
				<p>While designing, we assumed that users would be able to save their progress as they go and submit on the last page based on standard online forms. Design reviews with our team architects revealed that <span id="bold">information records in Salesforce must be created (i.e. submitted) after each step/form page, which meant saving inputs along the way wasn't possible</span>.</p>
				<p>Our lead designer incorporated the ability to edit Household step inputs in a <span id="bold">Summary step</span>, which replaced the Household Members step. This allowed users to recover from information entry errors. I updated button language to indicate creation rather than progression. <span id="bold">The last step was revised to become a confirmation page</span> rather than a summary page for form submission.</p>

				<h2><i class="far fa-thumbs-up" aria-hidden="true"></i> Handoff and approval</h2>
				<h3>Securing client approval</h3>
				<p>Our mockups, along with a list of Salesforce Lightning Design System components used, were handed off to team architects to create the flow that was presented by product managers to our client and approved!</p>
				<figure class="doodle">
					<img src="images/deloitte/approval.png" class="border-0 mb-4" alt="Party popper with streamers and confetti">
					<figcaption>Teamwork makes the dream work</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<h3>Reinforcing our design decisions</h3>
				<p>I created a <span id="bold">client deliverable</span> connecting each of our design decisions to <span id="bold">Nielsen's heuristics</span>, other <span id="bold">best practices</span> like the 8-point grid system, and <span id="bold">constraints</span> we found through iterations.</p>
				<p>This document would <span id="bold">prevent conflicts stemming from lack of design documentation</span> (like we saw in Round 3 of figuring out the flow steps) and <span id="bold">align all product and client team members</span> with our design, which was especially important since we didn't have explicit user insights to back us up. <a target="_top" href="mailto:anmluong@gmail.com">Please reach out if you would like to discuss the full deliverable.</a></p>

				<h2><i class="fas fa-shapes" aria-hidden="true"></i> What I learned</h2>
				<p><span id="bold">The traditional UX process isn't always possible on a real client project.</span> This was my first experience designing something to fruition outside of a controlled classroom environment, and I learned some of the basic constraints of designing in the real world. From not having user observations to being restricted by backend implementation, I had to recognize that design processes are unique to each project and move onto other alternative solutions.</p>
