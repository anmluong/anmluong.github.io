Teams were allowed to pursue any problem and solution without considering technical constraints. I led our 5-person team from research through mockups.

				<h3>Our starting point</h3>
				<p>Since we were given such an open-ended assignment, we wanted to focus on a specific topic. We were all sophomores at the time transitioning out of meal plans, so we decided on <span id="bold">college cooking</span>.</p>
				<h3>Students' perspectives on cooking</h3>
				<p>We needed to understand cooking from a student lens outside of our own, so each of us <span id="bold">conducted interviews with students of various cooking abilities</span>. From our interview notes, we each created work activity notes that were compiled into a <span id="bold">work activity affinity diagram</span> to inform potential design requirements. These were some of the common themes we saw.</p>

				<h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> The challenge</h2>
				<p>Our research led us to the following problem statement: Many college-aged students transition into independence from family-provided meals and college meal plans with limited or no cooking ability due to the intimidating learning curve of cooking. <span id="bold">How might we create an app that eases college students into home cooking in a novel manner?</span></p>

				<h3>Connecting insights with ideas</h3>
				<p>We matched each of our insights with a corresponding mobile app feature idea. A couple of these are shown below. One of our key features with <span id="bold">augmented reality was inspired by Pok&eacute;mon Go and Snapchat's uses of 3D visualizations</span>. From a functional stance, this aspect would provide a visual and personal guide to our student users. From an emotional stance, students would feel less intimidated because of the entertainment factor.</p>

				<h3>Creating wireframes for student feedback</h3>

				<h3>Introducing different recipe modes</h3>
				<p>To address our concerns and our classmates' concerns on the frequent switches between using a phone and cooking, we decided to implement voice commands and create a Still Mode and Active AR Mode.</p>

				<h2><i class="fas fa-redo" aria-hidden="true"></i> Revisiting our work</h2>
				<p>We had a lot of fun playing around with the idea of incorporating AR into the culinary space, and I wanted to revisit ARChef a year later to see how it could be improved in terms of organization and visuals.</p>
				<h3>Examining information architecture</h3>
				<p>Looking back on this project, we rushed towards wireframes and mockups without thoroughly considering how our features would be organized. I created the following IA of my team's final design.</p>
				<figure>
					<img src="images/archef/original-IA.png" class="border-0 mb-2" alt="Original IA showing organization of content into four tabs: Homepage, My Recipes, Profile, and Tools">
					<figcaption>IA for original design</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>From this, I realized how many features ended up appearing as second thoughts rather than intentionally incorporated features. <span id="bold">I revised the IA to emphasize the educational aspect of ARChef</span> and expanded the recipe view.</p>

					<figcaption>IA for redesign</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<h3>Detailing the AR feature with wireframes</h3>
				<p>In our original design mockups, we didn't flesh out the AR tutorial flow, so to understand what screens were needed for our main task of following a recipe, I created sketches that I turned into the following wire flows.</p>
				<p>From the recipe page, students <span id="bold">begin the tutorial through the video view</span>. To project visualizations onto their workspace (like guiding lines for chopping), students can select the <span id="bold">AR view</span>. For steps that have the <span id="bold">"Check" option</span>, students can ask the app to double check their progress, whether it's checking to see if a pan is too crowded or if an ingredient is diced finely enough. There is also an option for a <span id="bold">list view of the recipe steps</span>.</p>

				<h3>Main screens</h3>
				<p>This redesign incorporates <span id="bold">incremental learning</span> through <span id="bold">color-coded levels of cooking</span> that classify both recipes and tutorials. From <span id="italics">Discover</span>, students can search and bookmark new recipes. Under <span id="italics">My recipes</span>, students can access their previously saved recipes. They can also build their foundational skills through tutorials under <span id="italics">Learn</span>.

				<h3>Recipe tutorial</h3>
				<p>Before beginning a recipe, students scan their workspace to have ARChef <span id="bold">check off the ingredients list</span>. They then <span id="bold">start with the video tutorial</span> and have the option of using <span id="bold">AR mode</span> to see 2D visualizations of the steps on their workspace or asking for <span id="bold">Help</span> to make sure they're following the recipe correctly.</p>

				<h2><i class="fas fa-shapes" aria-hidden="true"></i> What I learned</h2>
				<p><span id="bold">It's important to avoid working in a silo.</span> Since we had left the AR concept so open-ended at the end of the semester, I struggled with how to build out the feature until I reached out to other students to get their ideas and feedback. Continuously checking in with others made the redesign process so much more fun and helped me avoid isolating the design to my own ideas and biases.</p>
