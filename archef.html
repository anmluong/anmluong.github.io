							<p>This was a semester-long group project for my Human-computer Interaction course in the Spring 2019 semester.

							<h3><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> Problem</h3>
							<p>Many college-aged students transition into independence from family meals and college meal plans with limited or no cooking ability due to the <span id="bold">intimidating learning curve of cooking</span>.

							<h3>Interviews</h3>
						</div>

						<div class="col-sm-12 col-lg-8">
							<h4>Student interviews</h4>
							<p>Each of our team members was responsible for conducting and taking notes for 2-3 interviews with college students, our envisioned user group. We coordinated as a team to make sure we <span id="bold">covered a variety of student cooking abilities/backgrounds</span> ranging from students with complete reliance on meal plans to those that enjoyed exploring new recipes. As a group, we conducted <span id="bold">11 interviews</span> with 5 inexperienced, 2 semi-experienced, and 4 experienced student cooks.</p>

							<p>To maintain interviewee anonymity throughout the design process, we assigned each interviewee an ID number (U1, U2, U3, etc.). Each team member was responsible for turning their raw interview notes into work activity notes, which were labeled by interviewee ID numbers.</p>

							<p>We compiled our collective 100+ work activity notes and organized them into a <span id="bold">work activity affinity diagram</span> to inform our design requirements. To do this, we employed a bottom-up approach to build clusters of related notes before determining higher-level categories. A team member then digitized this diagram for ease of future reference.</p>

							<p>These ideas were frequently echoed in the work activity notes:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><span id="bold">Motivation</span>: Students want/need to cook to sustain themselves, become more independent, and save more money - <span id="italics">All interviewees</span></li>
								<li><span id="bold">Barrier</span>: Students believe that cooking is time-consuming and intimidating because of the initial learning curve - <span id="italics">9/11 interviewees</span></li>
								<li><span id="bold">Barrier</span>: Students can't tell when something is done cooking - <span id="italics">6/11 interviewees</span></li>
								<li><span id="bold">Support/instruction</span>: Students rely on friends and family for personal cooking aid - <span id="italics">5/11 interviewees</span></li>
								<li><span id="bold">Support/instruction</span>: Students use online video and text recipes - <span id="italics">6/11 interviewees</span></li>
							</ul>

							<h4>Client interview</h4>

							<p>Our client was a registered dietitian at UVA who promotes balanced lifestyles through her cooking classes geared towards college students. She offered us insight into student cooking from her teaching experience, emphasizing the importance of the following in the context of student life:</p>
							<ul>
								<li><span id="bold">Cost efficiency</span>: Cooking at home saves more money compared to eating out.</li>
								<li><span id="bold">Personalization</span>: Each students' life situations are unique, so our solution must be able to accommodate different diets, time restrictions, etc.</li>
								<li><span id="bold">Incremental and foundational learning</span>: These two ideas break down the intimidating learning curve of cooking and allow students to gradually build their confidence for more complex dishes.</li>

								<p>I created the following low fidelity wireframes for our round-robin design critique in which teams rotated around the class to give each other feedback. In addition to gathering first impressions, we came in with these specific questions:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>How do you feel about different options for app navigation in terms of more navigation tabs (<span id="bold">visibility</span> with flat hierarchies) or less navigation tabs (<span id="bold">simplicity</span> with deep hierarchies)?</li>
									<li>How do you feel about the addition of a <span id="bold">social aspect</span> to ARChef where students can follow each other, have recipe photo feeds, etc.?</li>
									<li>How do you feel about using <span id="bold">accessories</span> with this app such as <span id="bold">AR glasses</span>?</li>

								<h3>Further considerations</h3>
							</div>
							<div class="col-sm-12 col-lg-8">
								<p>After considering features such as AR, machine learning, and image recognition, we recognized the difficulty of switching between phone usage and cooking. We then decided to implement voice commands and create a Still Mode and Active AR Mode.</p>
								<ul>
									<li><span id="bold">Still Mode</span>: Hands-off, projects the 3D visualizations onto a user-captured still image of the kitchen workspace so that students can set their phone down and follow along while cooking</li>
									<li><span id="bold">Active AR Mode</span>: Hands-on use of phone for app’s machine learning and image recognition technology to determine if user is ready to move to the next recipe step or if they're at risk of making a mistake (i.e. burning, overcooking)</li>

							<div class="row">
								<div class="col-sm-12 col-lg-6">
									<p><span id="bold">Personalization</span>: We included an onboarding questionnaire for users to customize their experience, eliminating any additional barriers to starting the learning process for cooking.</p>
									<p><span id="bold">Financial benefits</span>: To further incentivize home cooking, the cost comparison of cooking at home versus eating out is shown on each recipe page.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-sm-12 col-lg-6">
									<p><span id="bold">Visual guidance</span>: The AR tutorial, in combination with machine learning and image recognition technology, walks the user through each step of the recipe. This novel approach, inspired by Pokémon Go and Snapchat's uses of 3D visualizations, reduces the intimidation factor found in rushed recipe videos from professional chefs or the impersonal feel of a recipe text.</p>
									<p><span id="bold">Cooking education</span>: To further emphasize foundational skills, we included tutorials that students can utilize to reach their personal cooking goals.</p>
								</div>
							</div>

							<div class="section" id="reflection">
								<h2>Reflection</h2>
								<p>Since this project was purely design-based and not technically-constrained, we explored options that may not be realistic in implementation. For this project to move further, we would have to put much <span id="bold">more consideration into feasibility</span> and conduct further research into technical limits with augmented reality and machine learning.</p>

								<p>While we had fun entertaining the idea of recipe tutorials with 3D visualizations and building out how this technology would fit into kitchen usage, I would give <span id="bold">more careful consideration to the recipe screens</span> in the next design iteration. Although an AR tutorial adds a fun and novel aspect to cooking, an overwhelming recipe page may discourage users from continuing to or reaching the AR tutorial, which would add an additional barrier to the learning process.</p>
